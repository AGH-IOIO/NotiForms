* Running
Building and starint container:
  #+begin_src bash
docker build --target dev -t ioio-backend .
# Port mappings will differ depending on env variables
# 8080 represent local machine port, 80 represents container port
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 ioio-backend
  #+end_src

You can use ~run.sh~ script, however it has problem with image caching.
It keeps rebuild it each run. 
I don't want to deal with this right now.
  #+begin_src 
./run.sh
  #+end_src

** Environement variables
   - FLASK_HOST
   - FLASK_PORT
   - FLASK_DEBUG

Those can be set during image build-time or overwriten at run-time.
